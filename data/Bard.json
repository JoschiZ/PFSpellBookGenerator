While the target can build new memories, it has trouble accessing those gained before falling victim to the spell. The target can still speak and read any languages it knows and perform basic tasks, but it loses all class abilities, feats, and skill ranks gained before being affected by \u003Ci\u003Eamnesia\u003C/i\u003E. It retains its base attack bonus, saving throws bonuses, Combat Maneuver Bonus, Combat Maneuver Defense, total experience points, Hit Dice, and hit points. If the target gains a character level while suffering from \u003Ci\u003Eamnesia\u003C/i\u003E, it can use any abilities gained by that class level normally. If the class level it gained was from a class in which it already has levels, it gains the abilities of a 1st-level character of that class, even though it is technically of a higher level in that class. If the \u003Ci\u003Eamnesia\u003C/i\u003E is cured, the target regains the full abilities of the class, including those gained from any levels taken while suffering from this condition. \u003Ci\u003EAmnesia\u003C/i\u003E can be removed only by \u003Ci\u003Eheal\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Elimited \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Epsychic\u003C/i\u003E surgeryOA, or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":null,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":4,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":4,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":4,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"ShortDescription":"","Source":"Villain Codex"},{"Id":2757,"Name":"Covetous Urge","School":"enchantment","SubSchool":"compulsion","Descriptor":"curse, language-dependent, mind-affecting","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"V, S, M (a golden coin)","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"","Targets":"one living creature with 7 HD or fewer","Duration":"1 minute/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Will negates","SpellResistance":"yes","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou curse the target with insatiable greed, causing it to attempt to steal any item worth 100 gp or more that it can see, each time it enters a new room or area.

You determine the spell\u0027s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient\u0027s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp.
