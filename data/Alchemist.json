The drug doses the caster creates with this spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the drug may last far longer if taken before it decays.  The drugs created by this spell cannot be sold, but they can be given to other creatures.

The liquid functions in all the same ways as unholy water (see \u003Ci\u003Ecurse\u003C/i\u003E water). In addition, any creature that is anointed with or drinks this fluid must attempt a Fortitude save (drinking the \u003Ci\u003Ewaters of Lamashtu\u003C/i\u003E is particularly effective-a creature that drinks the liquid takes a -4 penalty on its save to resist its effects). Success causes the creature to become violently ill, vomit up the fluid, and become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Failure indicates the water takes root and wreaks havoc on the victim\u0027s mind (dealing 1d6 points of Intelligence damage) and twists and deforms its body (dealing 1d6 points of Dexterity damage).

The fluid can be created and stored indefinitely, though it cannot be created inside a creature. Extensive exposure to the \u003Ci\u003Ewaters of Lamashtu\u003C/i\u003E (such as drinking nothing else for months at a time) can have other long-term effects on the target, including the development of monstrous deformities or even total transformation into a beast, depending on the GM\u0027s discretion (these mutations are rarely, if ever, beneficial to the victim).\u003C/p\u003E","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":3,"Druid":3,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":2,"Summoner":null,"Witch":3,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":2,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":3},"ShortDescription":"","Source":"Book of the Damned"},{"Id":5002,"Name":"Infuse Self","School":"transmutation","SubSchool":"polymorph","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to assume)","Range":"personal","Area":"","Targets":"you","Duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","SavingThrow":"","SpellResistance":"","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EWhen you cast this spell, you assume the form of a native outsider from the following list: aasimar, aphorite (see page 224), duskwalker (see page 230), fetchlingB2, ganzi (see page 234), ifritB2, oreadB2, shabtiB5, suliB3, sylphB2, tiefling, or undineB2.
