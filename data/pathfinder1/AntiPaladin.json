A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired.

You make one dispel check (1d20 \u002B your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 \u002B the spell\u0027s caster level). If successful, that spell ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a 7th-level caster casts \u003Ci\u003Edispel magic\u003C/i\u003E, targeting a creature affected by \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E (caster level 12th) and \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E would have been dispelled, leaving the \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a \u003Ci\u003Ewall of\u003C/i\u003E fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster \u003Ci\u003Esummon\u003C/i\u003Eed by \u003Ci\u003Esummon\u003C/i\u003E monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item\u0027s caster level (DC = 11 \u002B the item\u0027s caster level). If you succeed, all the item\u0027s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a \u003Ci\u003Ebag of\u003C/i\u003E holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item\u0027s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact).

The shadows have no physical presence and don\u0027t move or animate. Instead, your words emerge from the shadow as a clear whisper, absent any accent or other identifying features. The targets can make conversation with the shadow, but must speak aloud to do so. The targets\u0027 voices emerge from your own shadow only when they intend to speak to the shadow, but you hear no other sounds from the target\u0027s immediate area. Their responses also emerge as clear whispers, absent identifying features, but you can instinctively identify which target is speaking to you through the shadow. Once the spell has been cast, you don\u0027t need to have line of effect to the targets or their shadows to communicate back and forth.  The shadow communication is audible, so it can be intercepted by adversaries who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. The spell can be silenced. You can\u0027t cast spells on subjects or otherwise establish line of effect through the shadows, but spells that allow you to speak or understand languages work normally across \u003Ci\u003Edark whispers\u003C/i\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Ultimate Intrigue","ShortDescription":"Whisper through the shadows."},{"School":"illusion","SubSchool":"glamer","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"yes","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":null,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":4,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":5,"Inquisitor":4,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":4,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":4,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S","NethysUrl":null,"Id":2456,"Name":"Deceitful Veneer","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"","Targets":"one creature","Duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Will negates","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou subtly alter both the target\u0027s aura and subtle cues in its body language, tone of voice, and word choice, which makes everything that the target says seem to be a lie.

An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u0027t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp.

You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather.
