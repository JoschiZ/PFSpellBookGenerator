Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a \u003Ci\u003Egate\u003C/i\u003E from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported.

This use of the spell creates a \u003Ci\u003Egate\u003C/i\u003E that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures.

An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service.

You must overcome a creature\u0027s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies\u0027 spell resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A \u003Ci\u003E\u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E against evil\u003C/i\u003E can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the \u003Ci\u003E\u003Ci\u003Elesser planar binding\u003C/i\u003E, planar binding,\u003C/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003Egreater planar binding\u003C/i\u003E spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E. The creature cannot cross the circle\u0027s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\u0027s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E spell for that creature only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature\u0027s extradimensional escape by casting a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E effect lasts as long as the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E does. The creature cannot reach across the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful diagram allows you to cast a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E during the round before casting any summoning spell. The \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E holds any called creatures in the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the \u003Ci\u003Elesser planar binding\u003C/i\u003E spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis spell is not cumulative with \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"abjuration","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"lawful","SpellResistance":"no; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":3,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":331,"Name":"Magic Circle against Chaos","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","Targets":"","Duration":"10 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle against evil,\u003C/i\u003E except that it is similar to \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from chaos\u003C/i\u003E instead of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, and it can imprison a nonlawful called creature.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"abjuration","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"evil","SpellResistance":"no; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":332,"Name":"Magic Circle against Good","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","Targets":"","Duration":"10 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle against evil,\u003C/i\u003E except that it is similar to \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from good\u003C/i\u003E instead of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"abjuration","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"chaotic","SpellResistance":"no; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":333,"Name":"Magic Circle against Law","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","Targets":"","Duration":"10 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle against evil,\u003C/i\u003E except that it is similar to \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from law\u003C/i\u003E instead of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"yes","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":5,"Wizard":5,"Cleric":null,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":5,"Summoner":4,"Witch":5,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":336,"Name":"Magic Jar","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"medium (100 ft. \u002B 10 ft./level)","Area":"","Targets":"one creature","Duration":"1 hour/level or until you return to your body","SavingThrow":"Will negates; see text","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EBy casting \u003Ci\u003E\u003Ci\u003Emagic jar\u003C/i\u003E,\u003C/i\u003E you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the \u003Ci\u003Emagic jar\u003C/i\u003E), leaving your body lifeless.

Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\u0027s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.

Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures.

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave\u0027s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels.

Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury.

On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM\u0027s discretion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave\u0027s crest.

Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination.

If no creature accepts the weapon, the subject drops the weapon on the ground.  \u003Ci\u003E3rd Priority\u003C/i\u003E: Cast beneficial spells and/or use beneficial magic items (including potions, wands, and so on) on creatures within 30 feet, starting with the closest creatures.  \u003Ci\u003E4th Priority\u003C/i\u003E: The subject gives away his non-worn possessions-the contents of a backpack or similar item count as one item each, as does the container itself-to creatures within 30 feet. If no creature accepts the items, the subject drops the items on the ground.  \u003Ci\u003E5th Priority\u003C/i\u003E: The subject gives away his remaining possessions (including his armor, boots, cloak, and so on) to creatures within 30 feet. If no creature accepts the items, the subject drops them on the ground.  If the subject fulfills all five priorities, the spell effect ends. The subject cannot attack or take attacks of opportunity, but can defend himself as normal.

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.  If you\u0027re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Mythic Adventures","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"enchantment","SubSchool":"compulsion","Descriptor":"mind-affecting","SpellResistance":"yes","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":null,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":3,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S","NethysUrl":null,"Id":1705,"Name":"Apparent Treachery","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"","Targets":"one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart","Duration":"1 round/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Will negates","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou shroud a number of creatures in an aura of suspicion and fill them with extreme paranoia regarding their allies.

You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you\u0027re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn\u0027t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.  You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don\u0027t find them disorienting.  When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell,  you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can\u0027t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn\u0027t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn\u0027t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.  The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same \u003Ci\u003Efireball\u003C/i\u003E, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by \u003Ci\u003Ehold person\u003C/i\u003E, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can\u0027t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don\u0027t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.  Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you\u0027re bilocating. For example, the \u003Ci\u003Ehold person\u003C/i\u003E spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds\u0027 worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an eagle\u0027s splendor e ffect t hat h ad 1 minute remaining when you cast \u003Ci\u003Ebilocation\u003C/i\u003E, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.  When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it\u0027s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can\u0027t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don\u0027t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can\u0027t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it\u0027s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don\u0027t realize they\u0027re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape  but you\u0027re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it\u0027s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn\u0027t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.  \u003Ci\u003ECreate mindscape\u003C/i\u003E can be made permanent with a \u003Ci\u003Epermanency\u003C/i\u003E spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.  When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet \u002B 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door\u0027s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape.

Creatures other than those you designate can\u0027t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.  When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you  from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you\u0027d cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can\u0027t prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.

Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further.

You can\u0027t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar \u003Ci\u003Econtact entity\u003C/i\u003E spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don\u0027t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u0027t  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn\u0027s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like \u003Ci\u003Escrying\u003C/i\u003E, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.

This spell disguises the zombie\u0027s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie\u0027s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie\u0027s normal staggered condition doesn\u0027t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u0027t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet \u002B 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won\u0027t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so.

A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the \u003Ci\u003Emaze\u003C/i\u003E, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees\u0027 branches.  \u003Ci\u003EHellscape\u003C/i\u003E: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air.

The creature can\u0027t attempt to escape the \u003Ci\u003Emaze\u003C/i\u003E while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage.

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters (manacles specifically designed to fit around the ankles). You also summon the restraints\u0027 key to your person; the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 \u002B your caster level \u002B the modifier of your primary casting ability score. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell\u0027s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell\u0027s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target\u0027s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together. As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per \u003Ci\u003Edimensional anchor\u003C/i\u003E with a duration of 1 minute per caster level.

(The emerald must be worth at least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the \u003Ci\u003Edimensional anchor\u003C/i\u003E effect described earlier.) If you cast this spell before the duration of a previous casting has lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or reset the previous spell\u0027s duration. If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use a component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to maintain the special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles.

You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface-you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.  The walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing  vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift\u0027s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift\u0027s walls have a Climb DC of 25.  When this spell\u0027s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift\u0027s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.  At any time during the spell\u0027s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell\u0027s duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area; these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via \u003Ci\u003Esummon monster VII\u003C/i\u003E and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the \u003Ci\u003Erift of ruin\u003C/i\u003E spell.

A sacrifice can be used in a variety of ways.  \u003Cb\u003EBargain\u003C/b\u003E: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being grants you a bonus on opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature into service for the next hour.  \u003Cb\u003EEnticement\u003C/b\u003E: Making a sacrifice the round before conjuring increases the DC of the Will save an outsider must attempt to resist being conjured.  \u003Cb\u003EPayment\u003C/b\u003E: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being allows you to pay for one service from the creature in commodities other than gold.  \u003Cb\u003EReinforcement\u003C/b\u003E: Making a sacrifice the round before creating a magic circle and preparing a summoning diagram amplifies the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of Charisma checks the creature might attempt to escape. This lasts 1 day.  Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration.  A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.  The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering\u0027s equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of \u003Ci\u003Eplanar ally\u003C/i\u003E. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature\u0027s choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.  You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a \u002B16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature\u0027s service.  \u003Cb\u003EGranted\u003C/b\u003E  \u003Cb\u003EType Sacrifice Bonus GP Value\u003C/b\u003E  Treasures 100 gp/HD of target \u002B1 Equal  Lives1 One living creature \u002B2 200 gp/HD with HD equal to target  Body/Mind1 Reduction of ability score \u002B4 500 gp/point by 1 reduced  Morals2 Alignment shifts one step \u002B6 1,000 gp/step toward target\u0027s  Soul1 One permanent negative \u002B8 2,500 gp level  1 When used to sacrifice a life, body, mind, or soul other than the caster\u0027s own, this is an evil act.  2 A character can sacrifice only her own morals, and can do so only once per lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Book of the Damned","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"conjuration","SubSchool":"summoning","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"yes (see text)","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":7,"Wizard":7,"Cleric":7,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":7,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":7,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":7,"Psychic":7,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":6,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M (a gem worth 1,000 gp per HD of the targeted creature or soul)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":4987,"Name":"Soul Transfer","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"","Targets":"one petitioner, incorporeal soul, or similar creature","Duration":"permanent; see text","SavingThrow":"Will negates","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like the spell completion option of \u003Ci\u003Etrap the soul\u003C/i\u003E, except it works only on bodiless souls (such as incorporeal undead or a soul trapped in a gem) and creatures whose substance is a physical incarnation of a soul (such as a petitioner).
