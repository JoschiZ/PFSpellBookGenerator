The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature\u0027s extradimensional escape by casting a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E effect lasts as long as the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E does. The creature cannot reach across the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful diagram allows you to cast a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E during the round before casting any summoning spell. The \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E holds any called creatures in the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the \u003Ci\u003Elesser planar binding\u003C/i\u003E spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis spell is not cumulative with \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"abjuration","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"lawful","SpellResistance":"no; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":3,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":331,"Name":"Magic Circle against Chaos","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","Targets":"","Duration":"10 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle against evil,\u003C/i\u003E except that it is similar to \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from chaos\u003C/i\u003E instead of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, and it can imprison a nonlawful called creature.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"abjuration","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"evil","SpellResistance":"no; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":332,"Name":"Magic Circle against Good","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","Targets":"","Duration":"10 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle against evil,\u003C/i\u003E except that it is similar to \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from good\u003C/i\u003E instead of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"abjuration","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"chaotic","SpellResistance":"no; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":333,"Name":"Magic Circle against Law","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature","Targets":"","Duration":"10 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle against evil,\u003C/i\u003E except that it is similar to \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from law\u003C/i\u003E instead of \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level."},{"School":"transmutation","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"yes (harmless, object)","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":1,"Druid":1,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":1,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":1,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":1},"Components":"V, S, DF","NethysUrl":null,"Id":339,"Name":"Magic Stone","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"up to three pebbles touched","Duration":"30 minutes or until discharged","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless, object)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung.

If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it.

You can\u0027t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar \u003Ci\u003Econtact entity\u003C/i\u003E spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don\u0027t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u0027t  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn\u0027s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like \u003Ci\u003Escrying\u003C/i\u003E, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.

It rises as a zombie (\u003Ci\u003EPathfinder RPG Bestiary\u003C/i\u003E 288) that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in \u003Ci\u003Eanimate dead\u003C/i\u003E, you can\u0027t control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.  This spell disguises the zombie\u0027s appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie\u0027s outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie\u0027s normal staggered condition doesn\u0027t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u0027t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet \u002B 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won\u0027t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through  physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.  When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E or \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E horde on a new corpse.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Horror Adventures","ShortDescription":" Control a zombie in human guise."},{"School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"evil","SpellResistance":"no","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":5,"Wizard":5,"Cleric":4,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":5,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":4,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":4,"Spiritualist":4,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M (an onyx worth 50 gp for each zombie and a silken string)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":2654,"Name":"Flesh Puppet Horde","CastingTime":"10 minutes","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"one or more corpses touched","Duration":"permanent (D)","SavingThrow":"none","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions as \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E, but can animate multiple zombies.

A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie\u0027s string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn\u0027t end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders.

A \u003Ci\u003Eflesh wall\u003C/i\u003E is 2 feet thick. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. As a move action, you can cause the fleshwall to constrict, shrinking it by a 5-foot square to fill the hole. Additionally, as a standard action, you can cause a 5-foot square of  the wall to permanently detach, forming a human zombie (\u003Ci\u003EBestiary\u003C/i\u003E 288) under your verbal control (this zombie doesn\u0027t count against your normal limit of commanded undead). The zombie reverts back into a normal corpse when the spell\u0027s effect ends. Each 5-foot square of the wall makes a single slam attack against an adjacent enemy on your turn, as a human zombie. The squares of the wall threaten their adjacent squares and can even provide flanking.  Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. The DC to move through the wall is equal to 15 \u002B your caster level. A creature that fails the check is trapped in the wall, takes 3d6 points of crushing damage, and is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the wall\u0027s slam attack.

When you call a creature using \u003Ci\u003Eplanar inquiry\u003C/i\u003E, the only task that you can ask of the creature is for it to answer questions or gather information regarding a specific topic (a person, a place, or a thing).

If it lacks such a skill, the called creature leaves for 1d4 hours to gather this information. Upon its return, you roll 1d20 \u002B your caster level, and use the result to determine what information the creature has gathered about the subject (as if using Diplomacy). The called creature stays for up to 10 minutes as it relays this information to you, after which it departs to its home plane.

This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell\u0027s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.  The casting of \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6\u002B5 minutes from the beginning of this spell\u0027s 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM\u0027s discretion.  The caster of \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E can pause the spell\u0027s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.  It is possible to cast \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM\u0027s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it\u0027s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell\u0027s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell\u0027s material component, information about the required focus, or even both.
