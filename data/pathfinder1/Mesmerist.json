Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a 7th-level caster casts \u003Ci\u003Edispel magic\u003C/i\u003E, targeting a creature affected by \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E (caster level 12th) and \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E would have been dispelled, leaving the \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a \u003Ci\u003Ewall of\u003C/i\u003E fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster \u003Ci\u003Esummon\u003C/i\u003Eed by \u003Ci\u003Esummon\u003C/i\u003E monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item\u0027s caster level (DC = 11 \u002B the item\u0027s caster level). If you succeed, all the item\u0027s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a \u003Ci\u003Ebag of\u003C/i\u003E holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item\u0027s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003ECounterspell\u003C/i\u003E: When \u003Ci\u003Edispel magic\u003C/i\u003E is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, \u003Ci\u003Edispel magic\u003C/i\u003E may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\u0027s spell.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"PFRPG Core","ShortDescription":"Cancels one magical spell or effect."},{"School":"illusion","SubSchool":"glamer","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"yes (harmless)","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":3,"Wizard":3,"Cleric":null,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":3,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":3,"Summoner":3,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":3,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":3,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":3,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, M (a small loop of leather)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":161,"Name":"Displacement","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"creature touched","Duration":"1 round/level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThe subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it\u0027s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can\u0027t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don\u0027t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can\u0027t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it\u0027s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don\u0027t realize they\u0027re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape  but you\u0027re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it\u0027s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn\u0027t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.  \u003Ci\u003ECreate mindscape\u003C/i\u003E can be made permanent with a \u003Ci\u003Epermanency\u003C/i\u003E spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

It takes 1d4\u002B1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion.

When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet \u002B 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door\u0027s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can\u0027t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E within that mindscape.
