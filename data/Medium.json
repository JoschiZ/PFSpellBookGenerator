The creature cannot reach across the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful diagram allows you to cast a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E during the round before casting any summoning spell. The \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E holds any called creatures in the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the \u003Ci\u003Elesser planar binding\u003C/i\u003E spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it.

You also learn the type and power of its alignment aura, as \u003Ci\u003Edetect evil\u003C/i\u003E.  \u003Cb\u003EEmotion Aura\u003C/b\u003E: The colors playing within the target\u0027s aura reveal its emotional state, granting valuable insight into its psyche. You learn a general summary of the target\u0027s current disposition, as well as its attitude toward any other creatures within 30 feet of it. For the duration of the spell and for 1 hour afterward, you gain a \u002B2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks you attempt against the target. Objects do not have emotion auras, except intelligent weapons and similar sentient oddities.  \u003Cb\u003EHealth Aura\u003C/b\u003E: The flow of vital force animating the target becomes plainly visible, giving you insight into its physical condition. You know whether the target is unharmed or wounded, whether it is poisoned or diseased, and whether it is under any of the following conditions: confused, disabled, dying, nauseated, panicked, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. Further, your insight into the overall strength of the target\u0027s vital force reveals the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource. Objects and most undead creatures don\u0027t have health auras.  \u003Cb\u003EMagic Aura\u003C/b\u003E: You determine the number and power of all magical auras on the target (as \u003Ci\u003Edetect magic\u003C/i\u003E to determine a \u003Ci\u003Emagic aura\u003C/i\u003E\u0027s power), as well as the school of each aura.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it\u0027s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can\u0027t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don\u0027t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can\u0027t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it\u0027s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don\u0027t realize they\u0027re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape  but you\u0027re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it\u0027s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn\u0027t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.  \u003Ci\u003ECreate mindscape\u003C/i\u003E can be made permanent with a \u003Ci\u003Epermanency\u003C/i\u003E spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.  When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet \u002B 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door\u0027s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can\u0027t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.  When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you  from creating the door if she is within the mindscape.

You don\u0027t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u0027t  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community.
