Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\u0027s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also can attune any number of creatures to the \u003Ci\u003E\u003Ci\u003Esymbol\u003C/i\u003E of \u003Ci\u003Edeath\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures.

Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. \u003Ci\u003EUnconscious agenda\u003C/i\u003E cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast.  If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003Ees until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell \u003Ci\u003Edominate person\u003C/i\u003E.

This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.

If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don\u0027t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u0027t  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn\u0027s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like \u003Ci\u003Escrying\u003C/i\u003E, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.

Successfully detecting the \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u0027t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp.

Once a creature is affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just beyond the range of focus or interaction. The grim stalker terrorizes the creature\u0027s sleep, affecting it as per \u003Ci\u003Enightmare\u003C/i\u003E every night during the spell\u0027s duration (Will negates for one night). Each time the creature takes hit point damage, the grim stalker lunges closer, causing the creature to become shaken for 1 round (Will negates). Each time the creature is reduced to less than one-tenth of its maximum hit points, the grim stalker lunges at the creature as an immediate action, affecting it as per \u003Ci\u003Ephantasmal killer\u003C/i\u003E.  Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell\u0027s haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim  stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a full-round action. The DC for this check equals the spell\u0027s save DC. Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as a Nessian warhound (\u003Ci\u003EPathfinder RPG Bestiary\u003C/i\u003E 173) in an available square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold. The grim stalker immediately attacks the affected creature, persisting until either it or the creature is slain, at which point the spell effect (and the warhound) disappears.\u003C/p\u003E","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":7,"Wizard":7,"Cleric":7,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":6,"Witch":7,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":7,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":6,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":7,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"ShortDescription":"","Source":"Haunted Heroes Handbook"},{"Id":2700,"Name":"Horrifying Visage","School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"haunted","Descriptor":"emotionUM, fear, mind-affecting","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"V, S, M (a live spider)","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"one 5-ft. cube/level (S)","Targets":"","Duration":"1 day/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Will negates","SpellResistance":"yes","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou channel residual feelings of terror into the minds of creatures within the area, causing those fears to manifest when confronted with a specific object.

This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell\u0027s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient\u0027s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp.

A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift\u0027s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift\u0027s walls have a Climb DC of 25.

You can use \u003Ci\u003Eread magic\u003C/i\u003E at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll\u0027s caster level.

The total spell levels of effects to be \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003Ed must not exceed 8. For example, you could use this spell to replicate the effects of \u003Ci\u003Efog cloud\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Esecure shelter\u003C/i\u003E, and \u003Ci\u003Esoften earth and stone\u003C/i\u003E (since these three spells have levels that add up to 8) or \u003Ci\u003Ediminish plants\u003C/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003Espike stones\u003C/i\u003E (since these two spells have levels that add up to 7), but not \u003Ci\u003Emove earth\u003C/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003Eplant growth\u003C/i\u003E (since these two spells have levels that add up to 9). If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-\u003Ci\u003Econtrol water\u003C/i\u003E, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it\u0027s a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM\u0027s discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended.  \u003Cb\u003EShape Realm\u003C/b\u003E: This functions similarly to \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003E demiplaneUM, except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane. You cannot grant the affected area an alignment or essence trait opposed by the plane\u0027s traits (such as granting the lawful-aligned trait to a portion of Elysium), and the area is not self-contained. At the GM\u0027s discretion, additional restrictions beyond those listed in the \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003E demiplane spell may limit this spell\u0027s effects, and additional options for customizing the affected area may be available. This version of the spell has a casting time of 4 hours and lasts for 1 day per caster level. This version of \u003Ci\u003Equintessence mastery\u003C/i\u003E can be made permanent in the same way and for the same cost as \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003E demiplane. This version of \u003Ci\u003Equintessence mastery\u003C/i\u003E does not function within the boundaries of a divine realm.\u003C/p\u003E","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":8,"Wizard":8,"Cleric":8,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":8,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":8,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"ShortDescription":"Exercise limited control over the quintessence of an Outer Plane, creating or shaping terrain.","Source":"Planar Adventures"},{"Id":5010,"Name":"Soulseeker","School":"divination","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 hour","Components":"V, S, M (incense worth 250 gp), F (see text)","Range":"unlimited","Area":"","Targets":"one soul","Duration":"instantaneous or 1 hour/level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (see text)","SpellResistance":"no","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou identify the stage of a given soul\u0027s judgment, or determine its fate post-judgment.
