If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 \u002B 1/2 your caster level \u002B your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A \u003Ci\u003Edimensional anchor\u003C/i\u003E cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E against evil) to make the trap more secure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature\u0027s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of \u002B0 to \u002B6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell\u0027s effect and can escape or attack you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped).

You cannot give your demiplane an alignment trait for an alignment you do not have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBountiful: Your demiplane gains a thriving natural ecology, with streams, ponds, waterfalls, and plants.

The demiplane does not have any animals unless you transport them there, but the ecology can sustain itself for as long as the demiplane exists without requiring watering, gardening, pollination, and so on, and dead organic material decays and returns to the soil in the normal manner.

The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using \u003Ci\u003Elimited \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E, mage\u0027s disjunction, \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E, or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E and making a successful dispel check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again.

If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control.

When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can\u0027t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone\u0027s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.  Each insects\u0027 size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (\u002B2 Dexterity, \u002B8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 \u002B 1/2 your caster level, and can\u0027t make attacks. Due to their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 \u002B 1/2 your caster level. The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a \u002B16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of \u002B0 for Huge or larger creatures).  You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are.

They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community.

Any creature that hits you with a non-reach melee weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed attack takes 3d6 points of damage plus 1 point per caster level you have (maximum \u002B20) of a type corresponding to the essence trait you chose. In addition, you take only half damage from attacks or effects of the associated damage type, and if such an attack or effect allows a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

A plane typically has a \u002B20 bonus on Will saves, and a demiplane typically has a \u002B15 bonus on Will saves. A plane\u0027s traits can further affect these bonuses: a mildly aligned plane receives a \u002B2 bonus, and a strongly aligned plane or a plane with the wild magic trait receives a \u002B4 bonus on its save.
