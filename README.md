This project aims to provide a simple way of building and managing your spellbooks for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.

## Data
The data for Pathfinders 1st edition was taken from the D20 Pathfinder Reference Document ([d20pfsrd](https://www.d20pfsrd.com)).
Pathfinder 2nd editions spell data comes from the [Pathfinder 2E Spell DB](https://github.com/fyjham-ts/Pathfinder-2E-Spell-DB).
This project wouldn't have been possible without those resources.
