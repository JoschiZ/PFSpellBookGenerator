You make one dispel check (1d20 \u002B your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 \u002B the spell\u0027s caster level).

Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a 7th-level caster casts \u003Ci\u003Edispel magic\u003C/i\u003E, targeting a creature affected by \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E (caster level 12th) and \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the \u003Ci\u003Estoneskin\u003C/i\u003E would have been dispelled, leaving the \u003Ci\u003Efly\u003C/i\u003E intact.

The creature cannot cross the circle\u0027s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\u0027s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E spell for that creature only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means.

Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful diagram allows you to cast a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E during the round before casting any summoning spell.

A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram.

You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  \u003Cb\u003EHealing\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty.

As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E decreases by 10 minutes, and you can\u0027t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell\u0027s duration.  \u003Cb\u003EMadness\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality.

You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.  \u003Cb\u003ERune\u003C/b\u003E: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of \u003Ci\u003Eglyphs of warding\u003C/i\u003E, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use \u003Ci\u003Eread magic\u003C/i\u003E at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll\u0027s caster level.  ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E: Your body visibly ripples with muscle.

Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a \u002B2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures.  \u003Cb\u003ETravel\u003C/b\u003E: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Constitution.  \u003Cb\u003ETrickery\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance changes as you desire (as \u003Ci\u003Eveil\u003C/i\u003E, except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a \u002B4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks.  VoidB6: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe.

You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather.
