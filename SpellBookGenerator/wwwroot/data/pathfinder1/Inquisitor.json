The creature cannot cross the circle\u0027s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\u0027s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E spell for that creature only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means.

The creature cannot reach across the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful diagram allows you to cast a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E during the round before casting any summoning spell.

A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the \u003Ci\u003Elesser planar binding\u003C/i\u003E spell), the DC increases by 5.

Creatures under the effect of \u003Ci\u003Eapparent treachery\u003C/i\u003E do not have allies and are not considered to be an ally to any other creature, including other creatures affected by this spell. They cannot move freely through their allies\u0027 spaces, flank creatures with them, cooperate with them using teamwork feats, or give or receive benefits from the aid another action or any spells or effect that affects only allies. If creatures affected by this spell are able to take attacks of opportunity, they always do so against provoking opponents, including those who were their allies before being affected by this spell.  A creature not under the effects of the spell who is trying to cast a spell against an affected target must succeed at an attack roll to touch the target, even if the spell is harmless, though the affected creature is not forced to attempt saving throws against harmless effects.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"AP 74","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"evocation","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"electricity","SpellResistance":"yes","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":2,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":3,"Inquisitor":3,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":2},"Components":"V, S","Id":1707,"Name":"Lightning Lash","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"personal","Area":"20-foot-radius spread","Targets":"","Duration":"1 round/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Fortitude negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou create a crackling lash of unholy lightning that flickers and flashes in your hand like a whip, shifting color in response to your mood and will.

Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E decreases by 10 minutes, and you can\u0027t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell\u0027s duration.  \u003Cb\u003EMadness\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality.

You can use \u003Ci\u003Eread magic\u003C/i\u003E at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll\u0027s caster level.

You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E.  \u003Cb\u003ESun\u003C/b\u003E: Your form blazes with solar light.
