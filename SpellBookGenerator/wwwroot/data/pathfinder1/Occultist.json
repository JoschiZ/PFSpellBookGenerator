The \u0022walls\u0022 and \u0022ceiling\u0022 of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border.

The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using \u003Ci\u003Elimited \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E, mage\u0027s disjunction, \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E, or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E and making a successful dispel check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again.

Once you have used this spell to gain information on a specific topic or event, you cannot use it for Knowledge checks regarding that topic or event again until you have gained a caster level.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Magic Tactics Toolbox","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"conjuration","SubSchool":"calling","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"no and yes; see text","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":null,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":4,"Witch":5,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":5,"Psychic":5,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":5,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S","NethysUrl":null,"Id":2547,"Name":"Bind Sage","CastingTime":"10 minutes","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels); see text","Area":"","Targets":"one caulborn (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 48)","Duration":"instantaneous","SavingThrow":"Will negates","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis variant of \u003Ci\u003Eplanar binding\u003C/i\u003E is specifically used to call one of the most knowledgeable types of outsiders: the immortal and prophetic caulborn (\u003Ci\u003EPathfinder RPG Bestiary 3\u003C/i\u003E 48).

They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community.

The zombie\u0027s normal staggered condition doesn\u0027t apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u0027t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet \u002B 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won\u0027t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through  physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.  When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E or \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E horde on a new corpse.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Horror Adventures","ShortDescription":" Control a zombie in human guise."},{"School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"evil","SpellResistance":"no","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":5,"Wizard":5,"Cleric":4,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":5,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":3,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":4,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":4,"Spiritualist":4,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"Components":"V, S, M (an onyx worth 50 gp for each zombie and a silken string)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":2654,"Name":"Flesh Puppet Horde","CastingTime":"10 minutes","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"one or more corpses touched","Duration":"permanent (D)","SavingThrow":"none","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions as \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E, but can animate multiple zombies.

This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell\u0027s effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient\u0027s body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp.

The drug doses the caster creates with this spell must be used within 1 minute of being conjured, or they dissolve into worthless dust or evaporate into noxious but fleeting vapors, though the effects of the drug may last far longer if taken before it decays.

As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E decreases by 10 minutes, and you can\u0027t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell\u0027s duration.  \u003Cb\u003EMadness\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect.  \u003Cb\u003EMagic\u003C/b\u003E: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 \u002B your caster level against hostile spells.  \u003Cb\u003ENobility\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as if you had cast the spell \u003Ci\u003Ecommand\u003C/i\u003E.  \u003Cb\u003EPlant\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance becomes plantlike, with leafy hair and green skin. You become immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning.  \u003Cb\u003EProtection\u003C/b\u003E: An aura of protective energy surrounds you.

You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.  \u003Cb\u003ERune\u003C/b\u003E: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of \u003Ci\u003Eglyphs of warding\u003C/i\u003E, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use \u003Ci\u003Eread magic\u003C/i\u003E at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll\u0027s caster level.  ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E.  \u003Cb\u003ESun\u003C/b\u003E: Your form blazes with solar light.

Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a \u002B2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures.  \u003Cb\u003ETravel\u003C/b\u003E: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Constitution.  \u003Cb\u003ETrickery\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance changes as you desire (as \u003Ci\u003Eveil\u003C/i\u003E, except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a \u002B4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks.  VoidB6: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe.
