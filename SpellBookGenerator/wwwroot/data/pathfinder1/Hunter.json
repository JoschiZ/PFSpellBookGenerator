This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it.

For example, \u003Ci\u003Ecure light wounds\u003C/i\u003E cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast \u003Ci\u003Eprayer\u003C/i\u003E, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target\u0027s friendship with the cleric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment.

If the target does not drain blood in this way while under the effects of this spell, it becomes exhausted at the end of the spell\u0027s duration.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Faiths Of Corruption","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","SpellResistance":"yes (harmless)","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":4,"Druid":5,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":4,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":4,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":5},"Components":"V, S, M (50 gp worth of powdered silver)","NethysUrl":null,"Id":1448,"Name":"Daemon Ward","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"living creature touched","Duration":"1 min./level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Edeath ward\u003C/i\u003E, except as noted above and it only protects against these attacks from daemons.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Horsemen Of The Apocalypse","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"disease, evil","SpellResistance":"yes","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":1,"Druid":1,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":1,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":1},"Components":"V, S","NethysUrl":null,"Id":1472,"Name":"Advanced Scurvy","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"living creature touched","Duration":"instantaneous","SavingThrow":"Fortitude negates","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThe subject contracts an advanced form of scurvy.

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.  If you\u0027re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.\u003C/p\u003E","Source":"Mythic Adventures","ShortDescription":""},{"School":"transmutation","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"poison","SpellResistance":"yes","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":4,"Druid":4,"Ranger":3,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":3},"Components":"V, S","NethysUrl":null,"Id":1706,"Name":"Film Of Filth","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"creature touched","Duration":"1 round/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Fortitude negates","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou cause the target\u0027s flesh to exude a layer of putrescent slime so foul that the target is sickened (Fortitude negates) for the duration of the spell and for 1d4 rounds thereafter.

In order to find these identifiers in a spell\u0027s aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge [arcana] check with a DC equal to 15 \u002B the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster\u0027s set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual.

In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round.

ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E: Your body visibly ripples with muscle.
