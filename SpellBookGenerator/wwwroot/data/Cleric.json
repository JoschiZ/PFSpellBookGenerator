The creature cannot cross the circle\u0027s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell\u0027s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E spell for that creature only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E leaves much to be desired as a trap.

The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means.

The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful diagram allows you to cast a \u003Ci\u003Edimensional \u003Ci\u003Eanchor\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E spell on the \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E during the round before casting any summoning spell.

A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a \u003Ci\u003Emagic circle\u003C/i\u003E prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the \u003Ci\u003Elesser planar binding\u003C/i\u003E spell), the DC increases by 5.

Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures.

It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \u0022walls\u0022 and \u0022ceiling\u0022 of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border.

The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using \u003Ci\u003Elimited \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/i\u003E, mage\u0027s disjunction, \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E, or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E and making a successful dispel check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again.

While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull \u0026 Shackles Player\u0027s Guide for details). The ship\u0027s pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell\u0027s effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel\u0027s normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.  The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won\u0027t accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell\u0027s duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition.

This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.

Additionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell\u0027s area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster\u0027s aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 \u002B the creature\u0027s caster level.  Finally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it.

Each intelligent creature in the spell\u0027s area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell\u0027s duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can\u0027t force  beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.

You can\u0027t send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar \u003Ci\u003Econtact entity\u003C/i\u003E spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don\u0027t know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn\u0027t  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn\u0027s overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like \u003Ci\u003Escrying\u003C/i\u003E, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.  Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire.

The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can\u0027t make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet \u002B 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won\u0027t move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through  physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.  When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E or \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E horde on a new corpse.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":3,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":4,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":3,"AntiPaladin":2,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":3,"Spiritualist":3,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"ShortDescription":" Control a zombie in human guise.","Source":"Horror Adventures"},{"Name":"Flesh Puppet Horde","School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"evil","CastingTime":"10 minutes","Components":"V, S, M (an onyx worth 50 gp for each zombie and a silken string)","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"one or more corpses touched","Duration":"permanent (D)","SavingThrow":"none","SpellResistance":"no","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions as \u003Ci\u003Eflesh puppet\u003C/i\u003E, but can animate multiple zombies.

While trapped in the object, the creature can\u0027t take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a \u003Ci\u003Efreedom\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E, or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature.  If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can\u0027t take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).  After 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature\u0027s Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.  After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.  After 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living  creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per possessionOA. However, the creature can\u0027t personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature.  Because the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you\u0027re away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn\u0027t reverse any of the effects.

The rune remains located on the glove\u0027s palm in an inert state for up to 1 minute per caster level.

You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface-you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.  The walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing  vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift\u0027s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift\u0027s walls have a Climb DC of 25.  When this spell\u0027s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift\u0027s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.  At any time during the spell\u0027s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action.

This lasts 1 day.  Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration.  A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.  The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering\u0027s equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of \u003Ci\u003Eplanar ally\u003C/i\u003E. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of \u003Ci\u003Emiracle\u003C/i\u003E or \u003Ci\u003Ewish\u003C/i\u003E. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature\u0027s choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.  You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a \u002B16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature\u0027s service.  \u003Cb\u003EGranted\u003C/b\u003E  \u003Cb\u003EType Sacrifice Bonus GP Value\u003C/b\u003E  Treasures 100 gp/HD of target \u002B1 Equal  Lives1 One living creature \u002B2 200 gp/HD with HD equal to target  Body/Mind1 Reduction of ability score \u002B4 500 gp/point by 1 reduced  Morals2 Alignment shifts one step \u002B6 1,000 gp/step toward target\u0027s  Soul1 One permanent negative \u002B8 2,500 gp level  1 When used to sacrifice a life, body, mind, or soul other than the caster\u0027s own, this is an evil act.  2 A character can sacrifice only her own morals, and can do so only once per lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":4,"Wizard":4,"Cleric":4,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"ShortDescription":"","Source":"Book of the Damned"},{"Name":"Soul Transfer","School":"conjuration","SubSchool":"summoning","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"V, S, M (a gem worth 1,000 gp per HD of the targeted creature or soul)","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"","Targets":"one petitioner, incorporeal soul, or similar creature","Duration":"permanent; see text","SavingThrow":"Will negates","SpellResistance":"yes (see text)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like the spell completion option of \u003Ci\u003Etrap the soul\u003C/i\u003E, except it works only on bodiless souls (such as incorporeal undead or a soul trapped in a gem) and creatures whose substance is a physical incarnation of a soul (such as a petitioner).

As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E decreases by 10 minutes, and you can\u0027t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell\u0027s duration.  \u003Cb\u003EMadness\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect.  \u003Cb\u003EMagic\u003C/b\u003E: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 \u002B your caster level against hostile spells.  \u003Cb\u003ENobility\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet. This effect functions as if you had cast the spell \u003Ci\u003Ecommand\u003C/i\u003E.  \u003Cb\u003EPlant\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance becomes plantlike, with leafy hair and green skin. You become immune to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning.  \u003Cb\u003EProtection\u003C/b\u003E: An aura of protective energy surrounds you. Select three of the following spells: \u003Ci\u003Edelay poison\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Efalse life\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Emage armor\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from chaos\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from evil\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from good\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Eprotection from law\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Eresist energy\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Eshield\u003C/i\u003E, or \u003Ci\u003Eshield\u003C/i\u003E of faith; you gain the protective benefits of those spells.  \u003Cb\u003ERepose\u003C/b\u003E: Your eyes become pure, bleak white. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom.  \u003Cb\u003ERune\u003C/b\u003E: Your skin is marked with runic tattoos. Your presence does not trigger the effects of \u003Ci\u003Eglyphs of warding\u003C/i\u003E, symbol spells, and similar effects unless you choose to, and you are immune to their harmful effects. You can use \u003Ci\u003Eread magic\u003C/i\u003E at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll\u0027s caster level.  ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E: Your body visibly ripples with muscle. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E.  \u003Cb\u003ESun\u003C/b\u003E: Your form blazes with solar light. You are immune to blindness, the dazzled condition, and all effects generated by powerful light (such as \u003Ci\u003Esearing light\u003C/i\u003E, \u003Ci\u003Esunray\u003C/i\u003E, or the blinding light of a shining childB2), and you radiate light as the \u003Ci\u003Edaylight\u003C/i\u003E spell. Creatures that are harmed or hindered by sunlight take a -2 penalty on attack rolls against you, and you gain a \u002B2 bonus on saving throws against effects originating from such creatures.  \u003Cb\u003ETravel\u003C/b\u003E: Faint afterimages trail behind you when you move. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Constitution.  \u003Cb\u003ETrickery\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance changes as you desire (as \u003Ci\u003Eveil\u003C/i\u003E, except affecting only yourself). Changing your appearance is a swift action. You gain a \u002B4 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks.  VoidB6: Your clothes and hair seem to float about you, as if you were adrift in a weightless environment. You are immune to cold damage and no longer need to breathe. You can exist comfortably in the depths of outer space.  \u003Cb\u003EWar\u003C/b\u003E: You are surrounded by the sounds of battle. You gain a \u002B2 insight bonus on attack rolls with your deity\u0027s favored weapon and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with your deity\u0027s favored weapon each time you hit a foe. You can use your deity\u0027s favored weapon as a divine focus or holy symbol.  \u003Cb\u003EWater\u003C/b\u003E: You gain gills, webbed fingers, and other ichthyic features. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet, can breathe water, and ignore the usual penalties on weapon attack and damage rolls from fighting underwater.  \u003Cb\u003EWeather\u003C/b\u003E: Your hair and clothing are constantly wind-tossed, and you crackle with electricity. You do not take penalties or damage or suffer from reduced visibility or other effects due to natural weather. You are immune to electricity damage, and your \u003Ci\u003Ecall lightning\u003C/i\u003E and \u003Ci\u003Ecall lightning\u003C/i\u003E storm spells and effects always function as though called outdoors in stormy weather.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":6,"Druid":null,"Ranger":4,"Bard":null,"Paladin":4,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":6,"Inquisitor":6,"Oracle":6,"AntiPaladin":4,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":null,"Medium":4,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":6,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":4},"ShortDescription":"Infuse yourself with the powers of your deity\u2019s planar realm.","Source":"Planar Adventures"},{"Name":"Judgment Undone","School":"necromancy","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"10 minutes","Components":"V, S, M (diamonds worth 50,000 gp), F (see text)","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"one willing petitioner","Duration":"instantaneous","SavingThrow":"none","SpellResistance":"no","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis powerful, elaborate, and risky spell undoes Pharasma\u0027s judgment, returning a willing petitioner to its mortal life. This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell\u0027s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.  The casting of \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6\u002B5 minutes from the beginning of this spell\u0027s 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM\u0027s discretion.  The caster of \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E can pause the spell\u0027s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.  It is possible to cast \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM\u0027s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it\u0027s not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell\u0027s casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell\u0027s material component, information about the required focus, or even both.

The total spell levels of effects to be \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003Ed must not exceed 8.

If a spell appears on different spell lists at different levels, use the lowest level-\u003Ci\u003Econtrol water\u003C/i\u003E, for example, counts as a 4th-level spell even though it\u0027s a 6th-level spell for sorcerers and wizards. This list need not be exhaustive; at the GM\u0027s discretion, this list may be expanded to include similar spells from other sources or similarly themed effects that do not mimic specific spells. This version of the spell has a casting time of 1 round and lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until its effects are expended.  \u003Cb\u003EShape Realm\u003C/b\u003E: This functions similarly to \u003Ci\u003Ecreate\u003C/i\u003E demiplaneUM, except that it alters an equivalent area of the plane the caster is on rather than creating a self-contained realm on the Astral or Ethereal Plane.
