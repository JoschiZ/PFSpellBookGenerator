This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave\u0027s type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM\u0027s discretion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave\u0027s crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited.

This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it.

For example, \u003Ci\u003Ecure light wounds\u003C/i\u003E cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast \u003Ci\u003Eprayer\u003C/i\u003E, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target\u0027s friendship with the cleric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment.

Casting \u003Ci\u003Eabsorb toxicity\u003C/i\u003E on yourself a second time does not allow you to absorb a second toxin, but instead resets the duration of the effect to its full 10 minutes/level.  While you have a disease or poison absorbed, you can use a melee touch attack to transfer that affliction to another creature. A missed attack does not discharge the spell, and you can try to transfer the affliction again in subsequent rounds. If you hit, this spell is discharged, and your target must make a saving throw against the transferred affliction (DC equal to this spell\u0027s save DC or the affliction\u0027s save DC, whichever is higher) or suffer its effect or initial effect immediately. The target then continues to suffer from the affliction\u0027s normal effects.  If the spell\u0027s duration expires before you have transferred the affliction, you are exposed to any absorbed poison or disease as if you had transferred it to yourself, but you gain a \u002B2 bonus on saves against that particular instance of the poison or disease.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":5,"Wizard":5,"Cleric":null,"Druid":4,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":3,"Summoner":null,"Witch":4,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":5,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":4},"ShortDescription":"You become immune to diseases and toxins, absorb one, and then spread it to others.","Source":"Ultimate Combat"},{"Name":"Air Bubble","School":"conjuration","SubSchool":"creation","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"S, M/DF (a small bladder filled with air)","Range":"touch","Area":"","Targets":"one creature or one object no larger than a Large two-handed weapon","Duration":"1 minute/level","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","SpellResistance":"yes (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAir bubble\u003C/i\u003E creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature\u0027s head or the touched object.

While the spell remains in effect, the target is immune to bleed effects and regains 1 hit point per round whenever below 0 hit points, as long as the target is still alive. This stabilizes the target. For each hit point restored in this way, the spell\u0027s total remaining duration is reduced by 1 hour.  \u003Ci\u003ESummer\u003C/i\u003E: The target is surrounded by tiny motes of light. While the spell remains in effect, the target\u0027s base speed increases 10 feet. The target may instead increase its base speed by 30 feet for 1 round by reducing the spell\u0027s total remaining duration by 1 hour.  \u003Ci\u003EFall\u003C/i\u003E: A cloak of autumn leaves appears on the target. While the spell remains in effect, the target gains a \u002B2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. The target can decide to roll twice on any saving throw against disease or poison and take the higher result by reducing the spell\u0027s total remaining duration by 1 hour.  \u003Ci\u003EWinter\u003C/i\u003E: A flutter of snow and crisp air surrounds the target. While this spell remains in effect, the target automatically succeeds at Acrobatics skill checks made to avoid falling while moving across slick or narrow surfaces. The target can move freely through difficult terrain for 1 round by reducing the spell\u0027s remaining duration by 1 hour. Difficult terrain created by magic affects the target normally.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":4,"Druid":3,"Ranger":3,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":3,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":3,"Psychic":null,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":3},"ShortDescription":"","Source":"Advanced Race Guide"},{"Name":"Whispering Lore","School":"divination","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 full-round action","Components":"V, S, M/DF (an owl\u0027s beak)","Range":"personal","Area":"","Targets":"you","Duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","SavingThrow":"","SpellResistance":"","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EUpon casting this spell, you are able to gain knowledge from the land itself.

This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.

The maximum HD of fey that you can call with that casting is equal to the result of your check - 20. For example, if your check result is a 24, the maximum HD for the called fey is 4. A high result doesn\u0027t allow you to break the HD maximum for the spell, and a result of 20 or less means you can\u0027t call a fey at all. If the fey doesn\u0027t like the sound of your offer, it can simply choose to refuse, in which case you don\u0027t expend any of the material components for the spell, either the offerings or the payment.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":null,"Druid":5,"Ranger":4,"Bard":4,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":null,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":null,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":5,"Psychic":null,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":4},"ShortDescription":"Entice service from a fey of 6 Hit Dice or fewer.","Source":"Ultimate Intrigue"},{"Name":"Glimpse Of Truth","School":"divination","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"V, S, M (a tourmaline costing 50 gp)","Range":"personal","Area":"","Targets":"you","Duration":"1 round","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","SpellResistance":"yes (harmless)","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThis spell functions like \u003Ci\u003Etrue seeing\u003C/i\u003E, except as noted above.\u003C/p\u003E","Magus":"","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":5,"Wizard":5,"Cleric":4,"Druid":5,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":5,"Summoner":null,"Witch":5,"Inquisitor":4,"Oracle":4,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":5,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":4,"Psychic":4,"Medium":3,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":4,"Spiritualist":5,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":5},"ShortDescription":"Gain true seeing for 1 round.","Source":"Ultimate Intrigue"},{"Name":"Insect Spies","School":"divination","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 round","Components":"V, S, M (a drop of honey)","Range":"close (25 ft. \u002B 5 ft./2 levels)","Area":"","Targets":"","Duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","SavingThrow":"none","SpellResistance":"no","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYou summon one or more glossy black beetles, which have a measure of intelligence and make for excellent spies. When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can\u0027t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone\u0027s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.  Each insects\u0027 size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (\u002B2 Dexterity, \u002B8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 \u002B 1/2 your caster level, and can\u0027t make attacks. Due to their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 \u002B 1/2 your caster level. The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a \u002B16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of \u002B0 for Huge or larger creatures).  You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are.
