Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not. Each target can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.  \n  \n This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn\u0027t otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient\u0027s vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.  \n  \n Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended.

They must use an additional action to open the door. If they can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to do so, the action or activity they used to open the door or container is wasted, and the door or container remains closed.  \n  **Failure**  The creature is thrown briefly backwards in time. The action or activity they used to open the door or container is wasted and they\u0027re returned to the position they were located at during the start of their turn. Their turn then ends.  \n  **Critical Failure**  As failure, but the temporal displacement also causes the creature to lose their bearings, making them confused for 1 minute.\n\n  **Heightened (10th)**  The temporal ward has an unlimited duration, until it is counteracted, Dismissed, or Disarmed.","Source":"Pathfinder #173: Doorway to the Red Star pg. 78","ShortDescription":"","Components":["material","somatic","verbal"],"Bloodline":null,"PatronTheme":null,"legacy content":true},{"NethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1727","Traits":["concentrate","manipulate","revelation"],"Type":"Spell","Level":6,"Traditions":["arcane","divine","occult","primal"],"Id":1241,"Name":"Truesight","action":"2","Range":"","Area":"","Targets":"","Duration":"10 minutes","SavingThrow":"","description":"You see things within 60 feet as they actually are.
