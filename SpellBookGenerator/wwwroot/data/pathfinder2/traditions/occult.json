Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not.

Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.  \n  \n This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn\u0027t otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient\u0027s vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.  \n  \n Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended.

This is a teleportation effect.  \n  \n You isolate the two targets for 1 round. During this time, fate refuses to allow either fated opponent to be affected by attacks or effects from a third party; a fated opponent could be affected by the other\u0027s meteor swarm or its own heal spell, but it would be entirely immune to a spell or Strike from a creature outside of the spells effects, as well including damage from a hazard or the environment. This doesn\u0027t apply to anything that was affecting the targets before you cast fated confrontation (such as a spell with a duration or persistent damage the creature had before it was affected by fated confrontation).  \n  \n For the duration of the spell, either fated opponent can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it makes against its fated opponent (a fortune effect), or force the fated opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a misfortune effect).  \n  \n This spell ends if either target becomes unable to act, or if they both agree to cease hostilities.","Source":"Secrets of Magic pg. 105 1.1","ShortDescription":"","Components":["material","somatic","verbal"],"Bloodline":null,"PatronTheme":null,"legacy content":true},{"NethysUrl":"https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1538","Traits":["concentrate","manipulate"],"Type":"Spell","Level":10,"Traditions":["Arcane","Occult"],"Id":1389,"Name":"Freeze Time","action":"3","Range":"","Area":"","Targets":"","Duration":"","SavingThrow":"","description":"You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no time at all.
