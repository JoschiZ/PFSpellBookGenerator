An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw.

Any creature that starts its turn within the area of the spinning blades takes 1d4 points of damage for every two caster levels (maximum 10d4 at 20th level) and the damage bypasses DR/silver.  Furthermore, the daggers ward off some attacks, in a way similar to the \u003Ci\u003Ewarding weapon\u003C/i\u003E spell (see page 48). While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat.

Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat.  Lastly, the blades that serve as the focus for this spell can be enchanted for greater effect. When all of the blades share the same enhancement bonus and special weapon qualities, a creature that is damaged by this spell is also treated as if hit by one of these weapons.

The space holds as many as 10 creatures of any size.  When this spell is cast upon a 5-foot-square part of a wall, it creates an extradimensional space adjacent to the Plane of Shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination.  Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can\u0027t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time.  The entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light. Any other level of light (brighter or darker) closes the entrance, trapping creatures inside the extradimensional space. If the entrance is closed when the spell expires, there is a 50% chance that creatures in it are ejected into the Shadow Plane instead of the location of the entrance.

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area\u0027s climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn\u0027t affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn\u0027t flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.  If you\u0027re at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.\u003C/p\u003E","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":7,"Wizard":7,"Cleric":7,"Druid":6,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":7,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":7,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":null,"Psychic":7,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":null,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":6},"ShortDescription":"","Source":"Mythic Adventures"},{"Id":1865,"Name":"Adhesive Blood","School":"transmutation","SubSchool":"","Descriptor":"","CastingTime":"1 standard action","Components":"V, S","Range":"personal","Area":"","Targets":"you","Duration":"1 minute/level","SavingThrow":"Reflex negates (see text)","SpellResistance":"no","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EYour blood thickens to becomes a glue-like substance upon contact with air.

You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you\u0027re carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn\u0027t duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.  You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don\u0027t find them disorienting.  When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell,  you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can\u0027t also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn\u0027t take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn\u0027t move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.  The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same \u003Ci\u003Efireball\u003C/i\u003E, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by \u003Ci\u003Ehold person\u003C/i\u003E, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can\u0027t be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don\u0027t count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.  Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you\u0027re bilocating. For example, the \u003Ci\u003Ehold person\u003C/i\u003E spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds\u0027 worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an eagle\u0027s splendor e ffect t hat h ad 1 minute remaining when you cast \u003Ci\u003Ebilocation\u003C/i\u003E, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.  When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it\u0027s harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can\u0027t make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don\u0027t need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can\u0027t see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it\u0027s relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don\u0027t realize they\u0027re in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape  but you\u0027re able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it\u0027s within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn\u0027t free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.  \u003Ci\u003ECreate mindscape\u003C/i\u003E can be made permanent with a \u003Ci\u003Epermanency\u003C/i\u003E spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

If you use \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E council to send a message to a sleeping creature that has \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E or \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E council prepared (or is able to cast it spontaneously or as a spell-like ability), the recipient can expend one of your allotted messages to cast that spell while remaining asleep. This uses up that creature\u0027s prepared spell, spell per day, or spell-like ability use as normal. Instead of replying to your message, that character is able to enter your \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Escape. If the sleeping recipient has the Lucid Dreamer feat, it can enter your \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Escape without casting either of those spells. While in the original caster\u0027s \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Escape, those involved in the council can interact with one another and that \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Escape for 10 minutes for each message remaining.

If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Escape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Eer awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.  You can use \u003Ci\u003E\u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E travel\u003C/i\u003E to travel to the \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003Es of outsiders. It takes 1d4\u002B1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination \u003Ci\u003Edream\u003C/i\u003E, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter.

Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren\u0027t inside it.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.  When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet \u002B 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door\u0027s conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can\u0027t perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.  When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you  from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you\u0027d cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can\u0027t prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.  Typically, a \u003Ci\u003Emindscape door\u003C/i\u003E operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose.

Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of \u003Ci\u003Ealleviate corruption\u003C/i\u003E doesn\u0027t reduce the target\u0027s corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.  Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 \u002B double the target\u0027s manifestation level \u002B 3 times the target\u0027s corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).  Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting \u003Ci\u003Ealleviate corruption\u003C/i\u003E on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it). A creature can be the beneficiary of this spell only once per week, whether it succeeds or not.\u003C/p\u003E","SpellGrades":{"Sorcerer":null,"Wizard":null,"Cleric":6,"Druid":null,"Ranger":null,"Bard":null,"Paladin":null,"Alchemist":null,"Summoner":null,"Witch":6,"Inquisitor":null,"Oracle":6,"AntiPaladin":null,"Magus":null,"Adept":null,"BloodRager":null,"Shaman":6,"Psychic":6,"Medium":null,"Mesmerist":null,"Occultist":null,"Spiritualist":6,"Skald":null,"Investigator":null,"Hunter":null},"ShortDescription":" Attempt to weaken a corruption\u2019s effect at risk to yourself.","Source":"Horror Adventures"},{"Id":2626,"Name":"Appearance Of Life","School":"illusion","SubSchool":"glamer","Descriptor":"evil","CastingTime":"1 round","Components":"V, S, M (one Tiny or larger living creature)","Range":"long (400 ft. \u002B 40 ft./caster level)","Area":"","Targets":"one or more undead creatures","Duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","SavingThrow":"Will disbelief or Will negates (see text)","SpellResistance":"no","DescriptionFormatted":"\u003Cp\u003EThe illusion makes undead creatures of Medium size or smaller appear as if they were living humanoid creatures.

Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast.

How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community.

This spell must be cast on the plane to which the petitioner was sent, and the petitioner must be present for the entire casting. In addition, the caster must provide a specific object that the petitioner valued deeply in its mortal life as a focus for the spell. This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily. At the completion of the spell\u0027s casting, the petitioner returns to the mortal form it had as a young adult, with all of its memories and class levels (or equivalent statistics) intact.  The casting of \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6\u002B5 minutes from the beginning of this spell\u0027s 10-minute casting time, an olethrosB6 appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM\u0027s discretion.  The caster of \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E can pause the spell\u0027s casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.  It is possible to cast \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM\u0027s discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast \u003Ci\u003Ejudgment undone\u003C/i\u003E is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp.
