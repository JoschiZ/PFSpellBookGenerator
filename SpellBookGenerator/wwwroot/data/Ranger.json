In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can\u0027t repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone\u0027s emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.  Each insects\u0027 size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (\u002B2 Dexterity, \u002B8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability).

The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a \u002B16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it.

Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell\u0027s casting, you can make a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw against the spell\u0027s DC, the locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead have manacles restrain the target\u0027s limbs in front of or behind it. If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both attacks and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can cause the set of manacles to bind the targets together. As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them. If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Large restraints. If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per \u003Ci\u003Edimensional anchor\u003C/i\u003E with a duration of 1 minute per caster level.

When you cast this spell, choose a domain offered by your deity. You gain that domain\u0027s benefits from the list below, along with the listed physical changes; abilities that allow a saving throw use this spell\u0027s DC. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can change which domain benefit you gain by concentrating for 1 round-this provokes attacks of opportunity and reduces the remaining duration of the spell by 10 minutes. If you have less than 10 minutes of the spell\u0027s duration remaining, you cannot change the selected domain in this way. If you change your domain, all ongoing effects from your previously chosen domain end.  You must worship a single divinity in order to cast this spell, even if you do not normally cast divine spells. If you perform an action that blatantly violates your deity\u0027s precepts while under this spell\u0027s effects, \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E immediately ends and you are stunned for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. \u003Ci\u003EInvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E has the same alignment descriptors ([chaotic], [evil], [good], or [lawful]) as your deity\u0027s alignment. If an ability duplicates a spell, it functions as that spell heightened to a level equal to your \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E spell.  \u003Cb\u003EAir\u003C/b\u003E: You become wispy and translucent.

While flying, you gain a \u002B1 dodge bonus to your AC.  \u003Cb\u003EAnimal\u003C/b\u003E: Your form becomes bestial with animalistic features. You gain low-light vision, scent, a \u002B6 natural armor bonus, and a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size. If you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you increased one size category. You can use \u003Ci\u003Espeak with animals\u003C/i\u003E at will.  \u003Cb\u003EArtifice\u003C/b\u003E: Parts of your body are replaced by pistons and gears. You can be affected by spells that specifically affect constructs (such as \u003Ci\u003Emake\u003C/i\u003E whole). You are immune to bleed, disease, and poison effects, and you gain a \u002B4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, mind-affecting effects, and necromancy effects.  \u003Cb\u003EChaos\u003C/b\u003E: Your flesh churns and swirls chaotically.

You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Charisma.  \u003Cb\u003ECommunity\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice echoes with the sound of multitudes.

You gain a \u002B2 bonus on damage rolls with two-handed melee weapons. Spells you cast that cause hit point damage have their save DCs (if any) increased by 1.

You are immune to fire. As a standard action once per minute, you can fire a ray of flame, as per \u003Ci\u003Escorching ray\u003C/i\u003E (limit one ray).  \u003Cb\u003EGlory\u003C/b\u003E: Your countenance becomes stern and implacable, and your wrath devastates the undead.

You are immune to fear and compulsion effects, and weapons you wield count as good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  \u003Cb\u003EHealing\u003C/b\u003E: Your appearance becomes hale and hearty. You gain fast healing 3, and your spells and class features that restore hit points each restore an additional 1d8 hit points.  \u003Cb\u003EKnowledge\u003C/b\u003E: You are surrounded by the sound of numerous turning pages. You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Intelligence.  \u003Cb\u003ELaw\u003C/b\u003E: A haze of mathematical symbols hovers around you.

You gain a \u002B6 enhancement bonus to Dexterity.  \u003Cb\u003ELuck\u003C/b\u003E: The faint sound of tinkling bells plays around you. You gain a \u002B1 luck bonus to your Armor Class and on attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. As an immediate action, you can force a single creature within 10 feet to reroll a single d20 it just rolled-you must use this ability before the results of the d20 roll are known. Each time you use this ability, the remaining duration of \u003Ci\u003Einvoke deity\u003C/i\u003E decreases by 10 minutes, and you can\u0027t use this ability if you have less than 10 minutes remaining of the spell\u0027s duration.  \u003Cb\u003EMadness\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice takes on an eerie, grating quality. As a standard action, you can inflict madness on a creature within 30 feet; that creature must succeed at a Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. You cannot target a creature more than once a minute with this effect.  \u003Cb\u003EMagic\u003C/b\u003E: You shimmer with magical power. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 \u002B your caster level against hostile spells.  \u003Cb\u003ENobility\u003C/b\u003E: Your voice becomes resonant and imperious. As a move action, you can issue one order to a single creature within 30 feet.

You can use \u003Ci\u003Eread magic\u003C/i\u003E at will and can resolve the effects of scrolls using your own caster level rather than the scroll\u0027s caster level.  ScalykindB6: Your flesh becomes squamous, and your mouth grows venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack that deals damage as normal for a creature of your size; if you already have a bite attack, the damage increases as if you had increased one size category. Each creature you bite must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds (or if already sickened, staggered for 1 round); this is a poison effect.  \u003Cb\u003EStrength\u003C/b\u003E: Your body visibly ripples with muscle.
